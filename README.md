## What is On Track?

Now, more than ever, it’s easy to get distracted in our modern technology-induced high-stimulus environments. 
This is especially detrimental when we find ourselves swiping Instagram during our ‘productive’ study session at the library. 
That’s where onTrack comes in.

On track isn't just another productivity app. On top of blocking apps, we also offer geofencing solutions to block specific apps at
specific locations such as university or home, something most other apps don't provide.

## How do I demo On Track?
The easiest way to demo the app is to [download it here.](https://github.com/WinterHack-2021/WinterHack-App/releases/tag/1.0)

Install the APK on your android device and give any permissions it asks. Hope you like it!! :)

If you wish, you can also run the app in a development environment to play/explore the source code.
This will have the added benefit to test the geofencing functionality of the app through emulation, as it might be quite hard to
travel out to test the app during lockdown!

To do so:
1. Ensure you have a flutter development environment set up. Follow the [official flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) to set this up.
1. Clone this repository, and run `flutter pub get` after adding flutter to your PATH environment variable.
1. Use an IDE with the flutter and android plugin to download an emulator (we used the Pixel 3a). Then, launch the app on the emulator.
1. You can now play around with the app and source code and emulate your location!
